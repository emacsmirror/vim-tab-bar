# vim-like-tab-bar.el

## Overview

The `vim-like-tab-bar.el` Emacs package makes `tab-bar` look in a manner reminiscent of Vim's tabbed browsing interface. It also makes sure that the `tab-bar` appearance remains consistent with the overall color scheme of the current theme.

This is how the Emacs `vim-like-tab-bar.el` package makes the `tab-bar` appear:
