The `vim-tab-bar.el` package enhances Emacs' built-in tab-bar, giving it a style similar to Vim's tabbed browsing interface. It also ensures that the tab-bar's appearance aligns with the current theme's overall color scheme, providing a consistent look for your Emacs tab-bar.

## Features

- The `vim-tab-bar.el` package ensures that tabs maintain a uniform appearance regardless of the theme used. This is also beneficial those who use themes that do not configure the tab-bar properly.
- Group Formatting: Optionally display and format tab groups.
- Makes the Emacs `tab-bar` (Emacs version >= 27.1) look in a manner reminiscent of Vim's tabbed browsing interface:
